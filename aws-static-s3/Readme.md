[![AWS Localstack Tutorial Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3_sqr0G9zb0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_sqr0G9zb0)

- `cdk-yt-tutorial` the CDK Tutorial final code
- `localstack` the localstack configuration that I used in the video
- `scripts` a collection of scripts for each step of the tutorial. Each one is a standalone script that does what I describe in the video, including querying DynamoDB from Lambda which I forgot to explain in the video while talking about CDK.
- `website` contains the static files of the template I used in the example
